Proof of concept Go (Emgo) to C translator.

This code is horrible convoluted. Mess growed when it was forced to handle more and more Go constructs that can't be one to one translated to C. But my knowledge about Go and C spec growed also, so now I probably know enough to write better one. See gotoc-ng.
