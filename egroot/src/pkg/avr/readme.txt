Contributor is need for AVR specific code.

Packages in avr directory should provide interface as much as possible compatibile with packages in cortexm directory.

Treat cortexm packages as template and don't change interface if you can. If you can't do some thing in cortexm way but you see that some change in cortexm can unify interfaces pleas fill a request for interface change to issue tracker.
